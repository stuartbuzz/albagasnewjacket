<p>
With the recent addition of Part P to the building Regulations, safety issues have been raised and recorded regarding safe isolation in domestic premises for all trades.
</p><p>
PlugSafe will enable domestic trade types such as Gas, Electric, Plumbing etc. as well as non electrically competent DIY enthusiasts to work in a quick, safe, confident and competent manner safe the knowledge that the appliance is isolated locally or remotely without the need to remove Plug tops and or Plug top Fuses.
</p><p>
PlugSafe was originally created for Gas Central Heating Service Engineers who were working on Appliances powered by a 3 pin Plug top.  There was a need for them to carry out a safe isolation process before commencing work.  Unfortunately, this meant that in order safely isolate to required standards, the Engineers had to execute a sometimes complex and laborious process before work commencement.
</p><p>
In most circumstances, the Engineers only ever isolated the appliance by removing the plug top from the Socket irrespective of plug top location before proving safe isolation and working.
</p><p>
Again most Engineers did not remove the plug top fuse and retain then apply warning notice. . This would not be classed as safe working as the fuse would not be removed and the chance of accidental power up would always be there.
</p><p>
This put both Engineers and the Customer at risk.
</p><p>
All of our research proved that most Tradesmen felt that their works current safe isolation process was too complex or time consuming.
</p> <p>
From these simple beginnings of finding a solution for Gas Service Engineers, Plug Safe has expanded to meet the market demand.  In particular, the Health and Safety divisions of various companies are keen to put the emphasis of simple safe isolation back onto the Engineer.
</p><p>
Various other industries have also expressed an interest in the need for a product that proves their appliance has not been used. This would retain the warranty for specialised commissioning purposes.

<H3>Commonly asked questions...</H3>
<p>
<b>Question:</b>  Will  PlugSafe fit all plug top manufacturer types?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> The PlugSafe safety enclosure is manufactured to ensure that it is suitable for all domestic 3 pin plug top types.  Always contact a qualified Electrician if in any doubt.
</p><p>
<b>Question:</b> What is the lifespan of the unit?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> PlugSafe has been tested to approximately 1600 bends before fracture
</p><p>
<b>Question:</b> I own my own Electrical Company.  Where is the benefit in me supplying these units to my Staff who are already trained to safely isolate?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> A lot of Electrical accidents happen to Electricians not because they are more at risk but because they chose not to carry out safe working practices.  Any tool that can help with their Job is a bonus.  If they chose not to use it and choose not to execute safe working practices then they could be deemed negligent.
</p><p>
<b>Question:</b> What's the point!?  It will only roll around in my Engineers toolbox along with their Multimeter that they never use!!<br>
<b>Answer:</b> Again, if they chose not to use it and choose not to execute safe working practices then they could be deemed negligent.  At the low cost price you will find most Businesses do not object to covering their business integrity and placing the work safety ethic back to their Engineers.
</p><p>
<b>Cost?</b><br>
&pound;5.00 per Unit exclusive of VAT.  This offer would only be available on orders over 500 units.
