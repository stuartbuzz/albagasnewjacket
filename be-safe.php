				<p>Gas Safe Registration No. 218421. This number is unique to Alba Gas.</p>
				
				<p>Gas Safe is now the official register for gas safety in the UK and the Isle of Man as of 1st April 2009. It replaced CORGI gas registration, which is no longer valid or recognised by law.</p>
				
				<p>As a Gas safe registered company all our work can be subject to inspection, ensuring that we deliver the highest quality and operate
within the gas safe laws.</p>

				<p>Here are some simple safety rules to follow.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Q. What should I do if I suspect my appliance is unsafe?</strong><br />
				A. Turn off the appliance and have it checked by a Gas Safe registered engineer.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Q. Why should I use a gas safe registered engineer?</strong><br />
				A. Using a Gas Safe registered engineer will ensure that all work completed will be done competently and safely.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Q. How will I know if the engineer is gas safe registered?</strong><br />
				A. All Gas Safe registered engineers carry ID cards telling you which appliances they are qualified
				to work on. Please make sure you ask to see their ID cards.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Q. Should I always follow the advice of a gas safe registered engineer?</strong><br />
				A. If a Gas Safe registered engineer recommends work that needs to be carried out on your
				appliance you should follow the advice given.</p>
                
                <p>Note:- Similar Rules and Advice apply to oil (OFTEC) and Solid Fuel (HETAS)</p>
